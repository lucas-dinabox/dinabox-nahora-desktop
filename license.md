Dear valued users,

We are excited to announce the launch of Nahora, our new time tracking app. This is the first version of the app and we are working hard to make it better every day.

While we believe that Nahora has a lot of potential, we recognize that there may be some issues and limitations in this initial release. We appreciate your understanding as we continue to make improvements and add new features.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for how we can make Nahora better, we would love to hear from you. Please reach out to us at [contact information].

Thank you for your support and we look forward to bringing you the best time tracking experience with Nahora.

Best regards,
The Nahora Team
